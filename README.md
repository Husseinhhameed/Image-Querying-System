# Image Querying System

This repository hosts the Python implementation of a simple image querying system demonstrated across two Jupyter notebooks. It is designed to allow users to search for images based on visual similarity.

## Project Overview

The prototype consists of three core components:
1. **Embedding Generator**: This module generates embeddings for images stored in our database, which helps in transforming visual content into a comparable vector form.
2. **Query Image Embedding Creator**: This module is responsible for generating embeddings for the images users query, enabling a matchable format against the database embeddings.
3. **Query Matcher**: This module compares embeddings from the query image against those in the database to find and return the most similar images.

## Usage

To run the notebooks and experiment with the image querying system:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
